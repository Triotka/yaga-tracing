The new calculus generalizes the ideas found in CDCL-style propositional SAT solvers to the first-order setting.},

	isbn = {978-3-319-40970-2},
	abstract = {This paper describes a major revision of the OpenSMT solver developed since 2008. The version 2 significantly improves its predecessor by providing a design that supports extensions, several critical bug fixes and performance improvements. The distinguishing feature of the new version is the support for a wide range of parallelization algorithms both on multi-core and cloud-computing environments. Presently the solver implements the quantifier free theories of uninterpreted functions and equalities and linear real arithmetics, and is released under the MIT license.},
